# gra_494 Midterm Project - Kerala Tourism
## Project Description

The application is a  website designed to showcase the picturesque beauty and cultural heritage of Kerala, India. Aimed at potential visitors, the application provides detailed information about tourist spots, activities, and booking details. 

## HTML Semantics and Accessibility Compliance

- **HTML Structure**: The project is structured using semantic HTML5 tags to ensure a well-organized and meaningful web experience. This includes `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`,`<footer>`.
  
- **Alt Attributes**: ARIA Roles and attributes were applied wherever necessary to provide additional context to assistive technologies, improving accessibility.

## CSS File Structure and Capabilities

- **BEM Methodology**: I have used the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) structure for CSS classes to enhance modularity and reusability.
  
- **Typography**: The project uses 'Arial', a sans-serif font, from Google Fonts with various weights and size for its typography.

- **Color Scheme**: The color scheme used in my CSS primarily revolves around a dark, monochrome palette.

## Resources Used

- **Google Fonts**: Uses 'Arial', a sans-serif font for its typography.
- **Google Icons**: Material Symbols Outlined for enriched user interface design.
- **JavaScript**: For potential interactivity and animations.
- **External Images**: Images hosted on external servers for social media icons, potentially from a Webflow asset library.
